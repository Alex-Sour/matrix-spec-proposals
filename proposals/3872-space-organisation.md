# MSC3872: Organisation of Spaces

Spaces are incredibly disorganized, unlike other platforms, such as [Revolt](https://revolt.chat), [Discord](https://discord.com) and [Slack](https://slack.com). Matrix Spaces are more similar to lists of Rooms.

To solve this issue, this MSC proposes new features to Spaces.

## Proposal

This MSC proposes Spaces to have:

1. A specific order of rooms that clients are sent upon joining, and that can be updated at any time with the right permissions
2. Categories for rooms (also with their own order) to help improve organization

This should greatly complement Spaces, and would make organisation and navigation simpler, especially since clients could implement features such as collapsing categories, drag-and-drop reordering and more.
