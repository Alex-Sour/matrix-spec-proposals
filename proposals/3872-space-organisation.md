# MSC3872: Order of rooms and subspaces in Spaces

Spaces are incredibly disorganized, unlike other platforms, such as [Revolt](https://revolt.chat), [Discord](https://discord.com) and [Slack](https://slack.com).

To solve this issue, this MSC proposes a custom, manual order for rooms and subspaces in Spaces.

## Proposal

This MSC proposes Spaces to have a specific, custom order of rooms and subspaces that clients are sent upon joining, and that can be updated at any time with the right permissions, which can then be reflected on other clients

This should greatly complement Spaces, and would make organisation and navigation simpler, especially since clients could implement features such as drag-and-drop reordering.
