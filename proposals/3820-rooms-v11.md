# MSC3604: Room Version 11

A new room version, `11`, is proposed using room version 10 (unspecified as of writing) as a base
and incorporating the following MSCs:

* [MSC2174](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2174) - Move `redacts` to sane place
* [MSC2176](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2176) - Update to redaction rules

Though other MSCs are capable of being included in this version, they do not have sufficient implementation to be
considered stable enough for v11 rooms. A future room version may still include them. Such examples of ineligible MSCs
are:

* [MSC2244](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2244) - Mass redactions
* [MSC2175](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2175) - Remove extraneous `creator` field
* [MSC2828](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2828) - Restrict allowed user IDs over federation
* [MSC1229](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/1229) - Mitigating abuse of `depth`

Room version 11 upon being added to the specification shall be considered stable. No other room versions are affected
by this MSC.

## Unstable prefix

Implementations looking to test v11 before written into the specification should use `org.matrix.msc3820.opt1`
as the room version, treating it as unstable.
