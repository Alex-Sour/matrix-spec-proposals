# MSC3575: Client syncing with sliding windows (aka Sync v3)

This MSC outlines a replacement for the CS API endpoint `/sync`.

The current `/sync` endpoint scales badly as the number of rooms on an account increases. It scales
badly because all rooms are returned to the client, and clients cannot opt-out of a large amount of
extraneous data such as receipts. On large accounts with thousands of rooms, the initial sync
operation can take minutes to perform. This significantly delays the initial login to Matrix clients,
and also makes incremental sync very heavy when resuming after any significant pause in usage.

## Goals

Any improved `/sync` mechanism had a number of goals:
 - Sync time should be independent of the number of rooms you are in.
 - Time from launch to confident usability should be as low as possible.
 - Time from login on existing accounts to usability should be as low as possible.
 - Bandwidth should be minimised.
 - Support lazy-loading of things like read receipts (and avoid sending unnecessary data to the client)
 - Support informing the client when room state changes from under it, due to state resolution.
 - Clients should be able to work correctly without ever syncing in the full set of rooms they’re in.
 - Don’t incremental sync rooms you don’t care about.
 - Combining uploaded filters with ad-hoc filter parameters (which isn’t possible with sync v2 today)
 - Servers should not need to store all past since tokens. If a since token has been discarded we should gracefully degrade to initial sync.
 - Ability to filter by space.
 - Ability to filter by room name.

These goals shaped the design of this proposal. 

## Proposal

At a high level, the proposal introduces a way for clients to filter and sort the rooms they are
joined to and then request a subset of the resulting list of rooms rather than the entire room list.
```
         All joined rooms on user's account
Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V B N M
\                                                 /
 \                                               /
  \      Subset of rooms matched by filters     /
   Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V
                       |
   A C D E F G H I J K L O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z     Rooms sorted by name (or by recency, etc)
   |_______|
       |

   A C D E F                                         first 5 rooms requested
```
It also introduces a number of new concepts which are explained in more detail later on:
 - Core API: The minimal API to be sync v3 compatible.
 - Extensions: Additional APIs which expose more data from the server e.g presence, device messages.
 - Sticky Parameters: Clients can specify request parameters once and have the server remember what
   they were, without forcing the client to resend the parameter every time.

## Core
A complete sync request looks like:
`POST /v3/sync?pos=4`:
```js
{
  // Sliding Window API
  "lists": [
    {
      "rooms": [ [0,99] ],
      "sort": [ "by_notification_count", "by_recency", "by_name" ],
      "required_state": [
        ["m.room.join_rules", ""],
        ["m.room.history_visibility", ""],
        ["m.space.child", "*"]
      ],
      "timeline_limit": 10,
      "filters": {
        "is_dm": true
      }
    }
  ],

  // Room Subscriptions API
  "room_subscriptions": {
      "!sub1:bar": {
          "required_state": [ ["*","*"] ],
          "timeline_limit": 50
      }
  },
  "unsubscribe_rooms": [ "!sub3:bar" ]

  // Extensions API
  "extensions": {}
}
```
An entire response looks like:
`HTTP 200 OK`
```js
{
  // Connection and Streaming API
  "initial": true,
  "pos": "5",

  // Sliding Window API
  "ops": [
    {
      "list": 0,
      "range": [0,99],
      "op": "SYNC",
      "rooms": [
        {
          "room_id": "!foo:bar",
          "name": "The calculated room name",
          "required_state": [
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.history_visibility", "state_key":"", "content":{"history_visibility":"joined"}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.space.child", "state_key":"!foo:example.com", "content":{"via":["example.com"]}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.space.child", "state_key":"!bar:example.com", "content":{"via":["example.com"]}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.space.child", "state_key":"!baz:example.com", "content":{"via":["example.com"]}}
          ],
          "timeline": [
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"A"}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"B"}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"C"}},
            {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"D"}},
          ],
          "notification_count": 54,
          "highlight_count": 3
        },
        // ... 99 more items
      ],
    }
  ],
  "counts": [1337], 

  // Room Subscriptions API
  "room_subscriptions": {
    "!sub1:bar": {
        "name": "Alice and Bob",
        "required_state": [
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.create", "state_key":"", "content":{"creator":"@alice:example.com"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.history_visibility", "state_key":"", "content":{"history_visibility":"joined"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.member", "state_key":"@alice:example.com", "content":{"membership":"join"}}
        ],
        "timeline": [
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.create", "state_key":"", "content":{"creator":"@alice:example.com"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.history_visibility", "state_key":"", "content":{"history_visibility":"joined"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.member", "state_key":"@alice:example.com", "content":{"membership":"join"}}
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"A"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"B"}},
        ],
        "notification_count": 1,
        "highlight_count": 0
    }
  }

  // Extensions API
  "extensions": {}
}
```
These fields and their interactions are explained in the next few sections. This forms the core of
the API. Additional data can be returned via "extensions". 

### Connections and streaming data

At a high level, the syncing mechanism creates a "connection" to the server to allow the
bi-directional exchange of JSON objects. This mechanism is ideally suited for WebSockets, but more
difficult to do for HTTP long-polling.

For the long-polling use case, this proposal includes an opaque token that is very similar to
`/sync` v2's `since` query parameter. This is called `pos` and represents the position in the stream
the client is currently at. Unlike `/sync` v2, this token is ephemeral and can be invalidated at any
time. When a client first connects to the server, no `pos` is specified. Also unlike `/sync` v2, this
token cannot be used with other APIs such as `/messages` or `/keys/changes`.

In simple servers, the `pos` may be an incrementing integer, but more complex servers may use vector
clocks or contain node identifying information in the token. Clients MUST treat `pos` as an opaque
value and not introspect it.

When a `pos` is invalidated, the server MUST treat the invalidated `pos` as if it was absent
(in other words that this is an initial sync) and set `initial: true` in the response to inform the
client that the response is now an initial sync. For clarity, `initial: true` MUST also be set when
there is no `pos` value provided. When there is a valid `pos`, this flag MUST be omitted (sending
`initial: false` is wasteful).

A response for a given `pos` must be idempotent to account for packet loss. For example:
```
Client                  Server 
  | ---------------------> |   data=[A,B], pos=2
  | <--data=[A,B], pos=2-- |
  |                        |   data=[C], pos=3  (new event arrives)
  | -----pos=2-----------> | 
  |   X--data=[C], pos=3-- |  Response is lost
  |                        |
  |                        | data=[C,D], pos=4  (another new event arrives)
  | -----pos=2-----------> | 
  | <----data=[C], pos=3-- | Server CANNOT send data=[C,D] pos=4, it MUST send the previous response
```
Failure to do this will result in duplicate data being sent to the client.

### Sticky request parameters

Request parameters can be "sticky". This means that their value is remembered across multiple requests.
Clients cannot choose which parameters are sticky, the API defines which parameters are sticky.
The lifetime of sticky request parameters are tied to a sync connection. When the connection is lost,
the request parameters are lost with it. This feature exists to allow clients to configure the sync
stream in a bandwidth-efficient way. For example, if all keys were sticky:
```
Client                         Server
  | ------{ "foo": "bar" }------> |  {"foo":"bar"}
  | <-------HTTP 200 OK---------- |
  | ------{ "baz": "quuz" }-----> | {"foo":"bar","baz":"quuz"}
  | <-------HTTP 200 OK---------- |
```
For complex nested data, APIs which include sticky parameters MUST indicate every sticky field to
avoid ambiguity. For example, an ambiguous API may state the following:
```js
{
    "foo": { // sticky
        "bar": 1,
        "baz": 2
    }
}
```
When this object is combined with an the additional object:
```js
{
    "foo": {
        "bar": 3
    }
}
```
What is the value of `baz`? Both unset and `2` are valid answers. For this reason, `baz` MUST
be marked as sticky if the desired result is `2`, else it will be unset.

Sticky request parameters SHOULD be set at the start of the connection and kept constant throughout
the lifetime of the connection. It is possible for clients and servers to disagree on the value of
a sticky request parameter in the event of packet loss:
```
             Client                         Server
               | ------{ "foo": "bar" }------> |  {"foo":"bar"}
{"foo":"bar"}  | <-------HTTP 200 OK---------- |
               | ------{ "baz": "quuz" }-----> | {"foo":"bar","baz":"quuz"}
               |      X--HTTP 200 OK---------- |
               | ------{ "baz": "quuz" }-----> | {"foo":"bar","baz":"quuz"}
               |      X--HTTP 200 OK---------- |
               | ------{ "baz": "quuz" }-----> | {"foo":"bar","baz":"quuz"}
               | <-------HTTP 200 OK---------- |
```
For this reason, some request parameters are not suitable to be made "sticky". These include parameters
which are extremely dynamic in nature, such as list ranges.

### Room List parameters

One or more room lists can be requested in sync v3 like so:
```js
{
  "lists": [
    {
      // Sliding window ranges, see the Sliding Window API for more information.
      "rooms": [ [0,99] ],
      // Sticky. List sort order. See Sliding Window API for more information.
      "sort": [ "by_notification_count", "by_recency", "by_name" ],

      // Sticky. Required state for each room returned. An array of event type and state key tuples.
      // Note that elements of this array are NOT sticky so they must be specified in full when they
      // are changed.
      "required_state": [
        // Request the join rules event. Note that the empty string is required here to match the event's blank state_key.
        ["m.room.join_rules", ""],
        ["m.room.history_visibility", ""],
        // Request all `m.room.member` state events.
        // The * is a special sentinel value meaning 'all keys'.
        // Note that `*` is NOT a generic glob function. You cannot specify `foo*` to pull in keys
        // like `food` and `foobar`. In this case, the * is treated as a literal *.
        ["m.room.member", "*"]
        // Request all state events.
        ["*", "*"]
      ],
      // Sticky. The maximum number of timeline events to return per response.
      "timeline_limit": 10,
      // Sticky. Filters to apply to the list before sorting.
      "filters": {
        // All fields below are Sticky.
        // All fields are applied with AND operators, hence if is_dm:true and is_encrypted:true
        // then only Encrypted DM rooms will be returned. The absence of fields implies no filter
        // on that criteria: it does NOT imply 'false'.

        // Flag which only returns rooms present (or not) in the DM section of account data.
        // If unset, both DM rooms and non-DM rooms are returned. If false, only non-DM rooms
        // are returned. If true, only DM rooms are returned.
        "is_dm": true,
        // A list of spaces which target rooms must be a part of. For every joined room for this
        // user, ensure that there is a parent space event which is in this list. If unset, all
        // rooms are included. Servers MUST NOT navigate subspaces. It is up to the client to
        // give a complete list of spaces to navigate. Only rooms directly in these spaces will be
        // returned.
        "spaces": ["!foo:bar", "!bar:baz"],
        // Flag which only returns rooms which have an `m.room.encryption` state event. If unset,
        // both encrypted and unencrypted rooms are returned. If false, only unencrypted rooms
        // are returned. If true, only encrypted rooms are returned.
        "is_encrypted": true,
        // Flag which only returns rooms the user is currently invited to. If unset, both invited
        // and joined rooms are returned. If false, no invited rooms are returned. If true, only
        // invited rooms are returned.
        "is_invite": true
      }
    }
  ],
}
```

_Rationale: There are use cases for clients requesting multiple lists. Many clients have DMs and
Invites in dedicated sections separate from the joined room list. API support for this is important
to ensure that the initial UI can load quickly. This is why the API allows multiple lists and there
are filters for things like DMs, Invites and Spaces. The timeline limit is very similar to Sync v2's
`room.timeline.limit` filter field and is required to ensure that busy rooms don't send vast amounts
of events. Wildcard matching on `required_state` fields are purposefully restricted to avoid clients
sending complex matching criteria (e.g pathological regular expressions) and in practice there seems
to be very little in-the-wild use of partial key matching like `foo*` as new state events tend to
namespaced by their event type. Fields in `required_state` are not sticky mainly due to semantics:
expressing deletions becomes hard. The inclusion of a dedicated `is_encrypted` filter exists for the
benefit of complex clients: see the E2EE section for more information._

The server will then return rooms which have the following fields:

```js
{
  "room_id": "!foo:bar",
  "name": "The calculated room name",
  // this is the CURRENT STATE, unlike sync v2
  "required_state": [
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.history_visibility", "state_key":"", "content":{"history_visibility":"joined"}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.space.child", "state_key":"!foo:example.com", "content":{"via":["example.com"]}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.space.child", "state_key":"!bar:example.com", "content":{"via":["example.com"]}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.space.child", "state_key":"!baz:example.com", "content":{"via":["example.com"]}}
  ],
  // Last event is most recent. Max timeline_limit events.
  "timeline": [
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"A"}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"B"}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"C"}},
    {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"D"}},
  ],
  "notification_count": 54, // same as sync v2
  "highlight_count": 3      // same as sync v2
}
```

_Rationale: The room name and counts are required for display on the UI. They are calculated server
side because they are required for sort operations on lists. The `required_state` is controversially
the **current state** which breaks from sync v2 which has the `state` be "the state before the start
of the timeline". Sync v2's rationale was event duplication (state events can appear in both the
state section and the timeline section if it's the current state) and the fact that clients would have
to rewind state to work out historical display names. Clients who show historical display names
already need to rewind state by inspecting the `prev_content` of an event to display text like
"@alice changed their name from Alice to Alice2". Event duplication may be
reduced using Event ID -> Event maps in the response should this be a concern. The benefit of
returning the current state is that servers can cache the latest state to return the response more
quickly. If, instead, servers returned the state at the start of a timeline block, servers are forced
to either rewind this state (as clients will need to do) or worse, do an expensive database access to
request the state before an event. As clients can be at different points in the stream for a given
room, this would force servers to cache every possible room state. It's not practical for servers to
cache every single possible earlier state for each room._

### Sliding Window API

At a high level, the sliding window API provides a way to synchronise a subslice of a list in a
bandwidth efficient way. It does this by referring to "operations" which must be performed on the
stored client list, such as INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE. Each operation has an index position OR a
range of index positions which tells the client where the operation should be performed. The
possible operations are:
 - `SYNC`: Sets a *range* of entries. Clients SHOULD discard what they previous knew about entries in
   this range.
 - `INSERT`: Sets a *single* entry. If the position is not empty then clients MUST move entries
   to the left or the right depending on where the closest empty space is.
 - `DELETE`: Remove a *single* entry. Often comes before an `INSERT` to allow entries to swap places.
 - `UPDATE`: Update a *single* entry. Updates are cumulative (consisting of deltas only).
 - `INVALIDATE`: Remove a *range* of entries. Clients MAY persist the invalidated range for offline
   support, but they should be treated as empty when additional operations which concern indexes in
   the range arrive from the server.


For example:
```
            Client                         Server
          []  |                              |  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8   index
              |                              | [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I]
              | -------- range[0,4] -------> |
 [A,B,C,D,E]  | <--- SYNC[0,4]=A,B,C,D,E --- |
              |                              |  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
              |                              | [H,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,I]  H moves to the front
              | ----- wait for updates ----> |
 [H,A,B,C,D]  | <- DELETE[4], INSERT[0]=H--- |
              |                              | [H',A,B,C,D,E,F,G,I] H is updated to H'
              | ----- wait for updates ----> |
[H',A,B,C,D]  | <------ UPDATE[0]=H'-------- |
              |                              |  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
              |                              | [J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R]  Entire list is replaced
              | ----- wait for updates ----> |
 [J,K,L,M,N]  | <----INVALIDATE[0,4]-------- |
              |      SYNC[0,4]=J,K,L,M,N     |
              |                              | [J,K,L,N,O,P,Q,R]    M is deleted
              | ----- wait for updates ----> |
 [J,K,L,N,O]  | <- DELETE[3], INSERT[4]=O--- |
```
The sync v3 API exposes this API shape via the following request parameters:
```js
{
  // Multiple lists can be requested
  "lists": [
    {
      // Multiple sliding windows inside a list can be requested. Integers are _inclusive_.
      "rooms": [ [0,9], [20,29] ],
      // How the list should be sorted on the server. The first value is applied first, then tiebreaks
      // are performed with the 2nd sort order, then the 3rd until there are no more sort orders left.
      "sort": [ "by_notification_count", "by_recency", "by_name" ],
      // Additional Room List request parameters omitted as they are
      // unrelated to the semantics of the sliding window, see previous section.
    }
  ],
}
```
Which returns the following response parameters:
```js
{
  "ops": [
    {
      // Which list is affected by this operation
      "list": 0,
      // Which index positions are affected.
      "range": [0,9],
      // The operation being performed on these index positions.
      "op": "SYNC",
      // The data to put in these positions.
      "rooms": [
        {
          "room_id": "!foo:bar",
          "name": "The calculated room name",
          // Additional response parameters omitted as they are
          // unrelated to the semantics of the sliding window.
          // See previous section on room list parameters.
        },
        // ... 9 more items
      ],
    }
  ],
  // The total number of entries in the list. Index positions match up to the lists in the request.
  "counts": [1337],
}
```

The possible `sort` operations are:
 - `by_recency`: Sort by `origin_server_ts` on the most recently _received_ event in the room. Note
   that due to clock drift over federation it is possible for rooms to re-order such that the most
   recently received event in the entire list does not cause that room to go to index position 0.
 - `by_highlight_count`: Sort by the `highlight_count` for this user in this room, which is the
   number of unread notifications for this room with the highlight flag set. This value is also present
   in sync v2.
 - `by_notification_count`: Sort by the `notification_count` for this user in this room, which is the
   total number of unread notifications for this room. This value is also present in sync v2.
 - `by_name`: Sort by room name lexicographically. This requires servers to implement the
   [room name calculation algorithm](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room).
   The server MUST perform the following steps:
     * Calculate the room name from this user's perspective. This may vary depending on the user as
       DM rooms will have the room name set to the name of the _other user_. This is the value that
       will be returned in the `name` field for the room but is NOT the value that the server should
       perform sort operations on. See following steps.
     * Remove any of the following characters from the beginning/end of the calculated name: `#!()):_@`.
       This ensures things like canonical aliases display in roughly the right locations rather than
       at the start as it starts with `#`.
     * Lower-case the result by unicode. This ensures `Matrix` and `matrix` sort in the same locations.
     * Perform sort operations on this 'canonicalised' name.

NOTE: It is known that by forcing servers to calculate the room name there can be problems concerning
multiple languages. "Alice and Bob" in English vs "Alice et Bob" in French for example, which may affect
sort ordering. This can be mitigated by adding a `lang` sticky request parameter to control how
i18n and l10n are done.

_Rationale: The sort operations are restrictive and limited in scope on purpose. Alternatives such
as arbitrary or more expansive sort orders like [RFC4790](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4790)
were decided against as it would A) force servers to support nonsensical and potentially expensive
operations and B) not produce the best sort order for specific use cases in Matrix such as alias handling._

The complete API shape for each operation is shown below (note the key names vary on the operation):

```js
{
  "list": 0,
  "index": 3,
  "op": "UPDATE",
  "room": { ... }
}

{
  "list": 0,
  "op": "DELETE",
  "index": 8
}

{
  "list": 0,
  "op": "INSERT",
  "index": 99,
  "room": { ... }
}

{
  "list": 0,
  "op": "INVALIDATE",
  "range": [100,199]
}

{
  "list": 0,
  "range": [100,117],
  "op": "SYNC",
  "rooms": [
    // ... 18 rooms with complete state ...
  ]
}
```

Note that clients will NOT be notified of any events or activity in rooms not in the sliding window.
This can be a problem for some use cases:
 - Following a permalink to a random room which is not in the window should be possible.
 - Receiving a direct @mention in a room not in the window should notify the client.

For the first of these issues, the sync v3 API exposes a "room subscription" API. For the second issue,
the sync v3 API exposes a "notifications" API.

### Room Subscription API

Sometimes clients know exactly which room they want to get information about e.g by following a
permalink or by refreshing a webapp currently viewing a specific room. The sliding window API alone
is insufficient for this use case because there's no way to say "please track this room explicitly".
The room subscription API serves as a way to provide this tracking. At a high level, the client
provides a map of room ID to room list parameters and the server then returns the response in the
same format as the sliding window API, just without the operations/indexes.

To track a room `!sub1:bar`, the client would send the following request:
```js
{
  "room_subscriptions": { // sticky
      "!sub1:bar": { // sticky
          "required_state": [ ["*","*"] ],
          "timeline_limit": 50
      }
  }
}
```
This would return the following response:
```js
{
  "room_subscriptions": {
    "!sub1:bar": {
        "name": "Alice and Bob",
        "required_state": [
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.create", "state_key":"", "content":{"creator":"@alice:example.com"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.history_visibility", "state_key":"", "content":{"history_visibility":"joined"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.member", "state_key":"@alice:example.com", "content":{"membership":"join","displayname":"Alice"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.member", "state_key":"@bob:example.com", "content":{"membership":"join","displayname":"Bob"}}
        ],
        "timeline": [
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.create", "state_key":"", "content":{"creator":"@alice:example.com"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.join_rules", "state_key":"", "content":{"join_rule":"invite"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.history_visibility", "state_key":"", "content":{"history_visibility":"joined"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.member", "state_key":"@alice:example.com", "content":{"membership":"join","displayname":"Alice"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.member", "state_key":"@bob:example.com", "content":{"membership":"join","displayname":"Bob"}}
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"A"}},
        {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"B"}},
        ],
        "notification_count": 1,
        "highlight_count": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Any updates in this room would be returned in the same section of the sync response:

```js
{
  "room_subscriptions": {
    "!sub1:bar": {
        "timeline": [
          {"sender":"@alice:example.com","type":"m.room.message", "content":{"body":"C"}},
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

Multiple rooms can be subscribed to by specifying additional keys in the room subscription map. If
a room is subscribed to multiple times, the _most recent_ subscription takes effect for the purposes
of `required_state` and `timeline_limit` filtering.

It is possible for a room to be both directly subscribed to _and_ in the sliding window. In this
case, only the room subscription section of the response will contain the data. The sliding window
will just contain the `room_id` and operation/index/list parameters.

To unsubscribe from a room, the client needs to send a request with the room ID to unsubscribe from in
the `unsubscribe_rooms` array:
```js
{
  "unsubscribe_rooms": [ "!sub1:bar" ]
}
```
This will delete that key from the `room_subscriptions` map on the server. It is common to for clients
to view one room then swap to another room. This can be modelled as a subscription on the new room
coupled with unsubscribing from the old room. For example, if the client swapped from viewing
`!sub1:bar` to `!sub2:bar`:
```js
{
  "room_subscriptions": {
      "!sub2:bar": {
          "required_state": [ ["*","*"] ],
          "timeline_limit": 50
      }
  }
  "unsubscribe_rooms": [ "!sub1:bar" ]
}
```

`unsubscribe_rooms` is cleared after every response, it is not sticky.

_Rationale: By using a map, this supports clients who can show multiple room timelines in the UI e.g
Hydrogen's grid view. The `unsubscribe_rooms` array allows rooms to be efficiently deleted from the
map. An alternative would be to specify an empty JSON object in the room subscription but that feels
less explicit than the array form._

### Notifications API
TODO

If you are tracking the top 5 rooms and an event arrives in the 6th room, you will be notified about
the event ONLY IF the sort order means the room bumps into the top 5. If for example you sorted
`by_name` then you won't be notified about the event in the 6th room, unless it's an `m.room.name`
event which moves the room into the top 5. In most "recent" sort orders a new event *will result* in
the 6th room bumping to the top of the list. A notable exception is when the rooms are sorted in
*alphabetical order* (`by_name`), which is what some other chat clients do for example. In this case,
you don't care about the event unless the event is a "highlightable" event (e.g direct @mention). 

- Required to show "unread messages" indicators on the room list.
- Unsure how much data to expose (probably index position + notif/highlight counts?). If we do _counts_
then we are doomed to send a response to a client every time an event is sent in a noisy room, which
seems rather wasteful. Perhaps make it configurable?

### Bandwidth optimisations for persistent clients
TODO

On re-establishing a sync connection, or re-requesting a page that was previously INVALIDATEd, the server will perform the following operations:
 - For this device/session: check the last sent event ID for the room ID in question. Count the number of timeline events from that point to the latest event. Call it `N`.
 - For this specific sync request: calculate a reasonable upper-bound for how many events will be returned in a reasonable worst-case scenario. This is simply `timeline_limit + len(required_state)` (ignoring `*` wildcards on state). Call it `M`.
 - If N > M then we would probably send more events if we did a delta than just telling the client everything from scratch, so issue a `SYNC` for this room.
 - If N < M then we don't have many events since the connection was last established, so just send the delta as an `UPDATE`.

This approach has numerous benefits:
 - In the common case when you scroll a room, you won't get any `SYNC`s for rooms that were invalidated because it's highly unlikely to receive 10+ events during the room scroll (assuming you scroll back up in reasonable time).
 - When you reconnect after sleeping your laptop overnight, most rooms will be `UPDATE`s, and busy rooms like Matrix HQ will be `SYNC`ed from fresh rather than sending 100s of events.

This imposes more restrictions on the server implementation:
 - Servers still need the absolute stream ordering for events to work out how many events from `$event_id` to `$latest_event_id`.
 - Servers need to remember the last sent event ID for each session for each room. If rooms share a single monotonically increasing stream, then this is a single integer per session (akin to today's sync tokens for PDU events). Servers need to remember _which rooms_ have been sent to the client, along with the stream position when that was sent. So it's basically a `map[string]int64`.


We need to make this opt-in to support dumb clients which don't remember history. Similar to `?full_state=` in sync v2.

### E2EE Handling
TODO

The server cannot calculate the `highlight_count` in E2EE rooms as it cannot read the message content.
This is a problem when clients want to sort by `highlight_count`. In comparison, the server can
calculate the name, `unread_count`, and work out the most recent timestamp when sorting by those
fields. What should the server do when the client wants to sort by `highlight_count` (which is pretty
typical!)? It can:
 - Assume `highlight_count == 1` whenever `unread_count > 0`. This ensures that E2EE rooms are always
   bumped above unreads in the list, but doesn't allow sorting within the list of highlighted rooms.
 - Assume `highlight_count == 0` always. This will always sort E2EE rooms below the highlight list,
   even if the E2EE room has a @mention.
 - Sort E2EE rooms in their own dedicated list: `{"filters": { "is_encrypted": true }}`

In all cases, the client needs to do additional work to calculate the `highlight_count`. When the
client is streaming this work is very small as it just concerns a single event. However, when the
client has been offline for a while there could be hundreds or thousands of missed events. There are
3 options here:
 - Do no work and immediately red-highlight the room. Risk of false positives.
 - Grab the last N messages and see if any of them are highlights. **Current implementations using sync v2 do this.**
 - Grab all the missed messages and see if any of them are highlights. Denial of service risk if there are thousands of messages.

Once the highlight count has been adequately *estimated* (it's only truly calculated if you grab all
messages), this may affect the sort order for this room - it may diverge from that of the server.
More specifically, it may bump the room up or down the list, depending on what the sort
implementation is for E2EE rooms (top of list or below rooms with highlights).

Client have two main choices here:
 - **Lite**: Keep E2EE rooms in the main list. This means the sort order won't always be strictly
   accurate for them but is fast to do. If you are sorting by highlight count then unread count
   (which is fairly typical) then E2EE rooms will always be bumped above all the unread count rooms
   if the resolution algorithm is set to "Assume `highlight_count == 1` whenever `unread_count > 0`".
 - **Heavy**: Sort E2EE rooms into a separate list (higher priority than the main list to
   de-duplicate them). Manually mix together the E2EE list and the main list depending on highlight
   counts. This means the sort order will be more accurate but is slower and more complex to perform.
   This is why there is an `is_encrpyted` filter on the room list parameters.

### Extensions
We anticipate that as more features land in Matrix, different kinds of data will also want to be synced
to clients. Sync v2 did not have any first-class support to opt-in to new data. Sync v3 does have
support for this via "extensions". Extensions also allow this proposal to be broken up into more
manageable sections. Extensions are requested by the client in a dedicated `extensions` block:
```js
{
    "extensions": {
        "name_of_extension": { // sticky
            "enabled": true, // sticky
            "extension_arg": "value",
            "extension_arg_2": true
        }
    }
}
```
Extensions MUST have an `enabled` flag which defaults to `false`. If a client sends an unknown extension
name, the server MUST ignore it (or else backwards compatibility between servers is broken when a newer
client tries to communicate with an older server). Extension args may or may not be sticky, it
depends on the extension.

Extensions can leverage the data from the core API, notably which rooms are currently inside sliding
windows as well as which rooms are explicitly subscribed to.

In an effort to reduce the size of this proposal, extensions will be done in separate MSCs. There will
be extensions for:
 - To Device Messaging - [spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#extensions-to-sync)
 - End-to-End Encryption - [spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#extensions-to-sync-1)
 - Ephemeral Events - typing notifications, receipts: [spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#client-behaviour-4)
 - Presence - `presence` in sync v2: [spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync)
 - Account Data - `account_data` in sync v2: [spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync)

_Rationale: The name 'extensions' is inspired by the spec itself which refers to "Extensions to /sync"
multiple times. These additional bits of data are all generally outside the scope of the core room
graph and room list so are well-placed for being treated separately. Furthermore, it is possible to
make a meaningful client which only supports the core API and no extensions, as the core controls
the room list and ability to receive events and state in a room. For clients which don't do E2EE and
don't handle presence/typing/receipts/other metadata, they can simply work with this MSC alone and
in full._
